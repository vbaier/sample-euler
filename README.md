# sample-euler

This is my sample solution for one of the many excellent [Project Euler Problems](https://projecteuler.net/). In the interest of not ruining the fun, I won't reveal which, but it's a reasonably quick python search for special numbers that relies heavily base-conversion. Take a quick look if Project Euler interests you.

Run on Python 3.7+ with no special dependencies required
